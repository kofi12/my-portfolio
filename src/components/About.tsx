        Today’s customers don’t flip through phone books — they Google. They’re
        searching online for services, reviews, and businesses that feel
        legitimate and trustworthy. If your business doesn’t show up — or if
        your website looks outdated — you’re already losing them to competitors
        who made the effort.

        Your website is your digital storefront. It’s open 24/7, it sets the
        tone for your brand, and it often makes the first — and last —
        impression. A modern, professional site builds credibility, captures
        attention, and turns curious visitors into paying customers.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-6 leading-relaxed">
        Whether you’re a local bakery or a growing service provider, having a
        great website isn’t just nice — it’s non-negotiable.
